To print the zine, make sure you select 'scale to fit' or 'print entire image' on your printer. You will have to trim off about ½ inch of excess, but this will ensure that nothing is cut off.

Once you print the zine, fold in half hamburger style, then hotdog style to form a 4-page booklet. Trim off the excess and start tracking your collection.
